Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) has emerged as an essential task
within text understanding systems to determine the inferential relationships
between sentences. Recognition of textual inferences has been extended to
both syntactic and semantic levels. In contrast, the development of RTE
models for the Indonesian language remains constrained to the lexical sen-
tence level, thus neglecting syntactic dependencies among words within the
Premise (P) and Hypothesis (H) sentences. This oversight results in the ir-
relevant capture of information within the Premise sentences. In this study,
we proposed an approach deep learning architecture for RTE that can learn
sequence information from sentence pairs, which are transformed into in-
dividual Head-Dependency words (Biplet h-d) derived from the word-pair-
dependency process to capture the syntactic of words. Each Biplet pair
undergoes a direct comparison within the given pair segments. In addition,
we use BiLSTM augmented with multi-head attention to emphasize critical
words more.
